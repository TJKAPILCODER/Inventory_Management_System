Inventory Management System

Overview

This project is a JavaFX-based Inventory Management System developed as part of a Computer Science course project. The system was designed to address the needs of a small manufacturing organization, replacing their spreadsheet-based inventory management process with a more robust and feature-rich application.

The project demonstrates proficiency in building GUI applications, implementing object-oriented principles, and handling data validation and exception control.

Purpose

The purpose of this project was to create a functional inventory management system that allows users to:

- Add, modify, and delete parts and products.
- Associate parts with products to track relationships.
- Search efficiently for parts and products.
- Handle invalid input and exceptions to maintain data integrity.
- This system provides a scalable and user-friendly solution tailored for managing inventory in a small business.
  
Features
User Interface:
Developed using JavaFX, the GUI includes:

Main Screen:

- Lists for parts and products.
- Buttons to add, modify, delete, search, and exit.
- Search functionality for both parts and products.
- Add/Modify Part Screens:
- Fields for entering or updating part details (ID, name, price, inventory level, etc.).
- Radio buttons to select between "In-House" or "Outsourced" parts.
- Save and cancel functionality.

Add/Modify Product Screens:

- Fields for entering or updating product details (ID, name, price, inventory level, etc.).
- Functionality to associate or disassociate parts with products.
- Save and cancel functionality.
- Core Functionalities
  
CRUD Operations:

- Add, modify, and delete parts and products.
- Search Functionality:
- Search for parts or products by ID or name.
- Validation and Error Handling:
- Ensure logical consistency (e.g., inventory levels must be between min and max values).
- Prevent invalid operations (e.g., saving products without associated parts).
  
Technologies Used:

- Java: Core programming language for the application.
- JavaFX: Used to create the graphical user interface.
- Object-Oriented Design: Implemented classes and methods based on a structured UML class diagram.
- Exception Handling: Custom error messages to improve usability and maintain data integrity.
  
Benefits:
- Improved Efficiency: Automates tasks like adding, modifying, and searching inventory.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simplifies inventory management with intuitive navigation and controls.
- Scalability: Designed with object-oriented principles, making it easy to extend and enhance.
- Data Validation: Ensures accurate data entry and prevents logical errors.

Scenario:
- This system was developed for a small manufacturing organization that needed to transition from a manual, spreadsheet-based inventory system to a more efficient, automated solution. The requirements included:
  
- A graphical user interface for managing parts and products.
- Functionality to add, modify, delete, and associate parts with products.
- Robust data validation and error handling to prevent invalid operations.

How It Works
Main Screen:

- View and search for parts and products.
- Navigate to add or modify screens for both parts and products.
  
Add/Modify Part:

- Enter or update part details.
- Select between "In-House" or "Outsourced" parts.
- Save changes or cancel the operation.
  
Add/Modify Product:

- Enter or update product details.
- Associate parts with products or remove associations.
- Save changes or cancel the operation.
- Validation and Error Handling:
- Prevent invalid input, such as inventory values outside the specified range.
- Ensure that products cannot be saved without associated parts.
  
Key Learning Outcomes:
JavaFX Development:

- Built a functional and visually appealing graphical user interface.
- Object-Oriented Programming:
- Designed and implemented a modular class structure.
- Data Validation and Exception Handling:
- Ensured logical consistency and error-free operation.
  
Problem-Solving:

- Translated business requirements into a working software solution.
- Data Validation and Exception Handling:
